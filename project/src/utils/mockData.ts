    content: 'Medical researchers have announced a significant breakthrough in cancer detection technology that could transform early diagnosis protocols worldwide. The new blood test, developed after a decade of research, can detect molecular signatures of up to 50 different cancer types up to four years before conventional diagnostic methods.\n\n"The implications for survival rates are enormous," explained the lead researcher. "When cancer is detected at stage one, survival rates can be as high as 90% compared to as low as 10% for late-stage diagnosis."\n\nClinical trials involving 10,000 participants showed the test has a sensitivity of 99.3% with a false positive rate of just 0.07%. Medical authorities are fast-tracking approval processes with expectations that the test could be widely available within 18 months.',
